# Power System

> - I'm a student :D

Power System is a <b>simple</b> system to do some file manipulation, *fun* stuff, <b>play music</b>, etc.

This program is extremely simple (probably because I'm just a C++ student :D), and at the same time simple.

Note: This program uses [HiEasyX](https://github.com/zouhuidong/HiEasyX) as the graphics library, and this README is translated with [Google Translate](https://translate.google.cn/).
